%CREATE_CT_OPERATOR_2D_PARALLEL_ASTRA_CPU Create 2D CT forward model
%   A = create_ct_operator_2d_parallel_astra( xDim, yDim, nDet, angles ) computes the 
%   forward model, i.e. X-ray projection operator, for the 2D parallel-beam CT
%   project given in input parameters. The x- and y-dimensions of the CT volume 
%   are given by parameters ''xDim'' and ''yDim'', respectively. The imaging 
%   geometry is created using the number of detector elements ''nDet'' and
%   given projection angles ''angles'' (in radians!)
%   It is assumed that a flat detector has been used for the X-ray projection 
%   measurements. The pixel size (in mm) is fixed for simplicity.
%
%   The forward model is an operator that behaves like a matrix, for
%   example in operations like A*x and and A.'*x, but no explicit matrix is
%   actually created.
%
%   Use of this function requires that the ASTRA Tomography Toolbox 
%   (https://www.astra-toolbox.com/) and the Spot Linear-Operator Toolbox 
%   (https://www.cs.ubc.ca/labs/scl/spot/) have been added to the MATLAB 
%   path.
%
%   This function is adapted from the HelTomo Toolbox, which was created 
%   primarily for use with CT data measured in the Industrial Mathematics 
%   Computed Tomography Laboratory at the University of Helsinki.
